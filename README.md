# cifar10 Dataset
 CIFAR10 is a dataset consisting of over 60,000 - 32 x 32 color images in 10 classes (airplane,automobile,bird,cat,deer,dog etc.) 
 with 1000 images per class in training folder and testing folder. In this tutorial, I have used the cifar10 dataset to train a convolutional neural network model to predict the type of an image and its percentage of confidence.
